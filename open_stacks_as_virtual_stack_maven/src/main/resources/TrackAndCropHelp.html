<h3>Tracking: Radii</h3>
<p width=400>
    The tracking is based on computing the center of mass in a region whose
    size you can adjust here. The radii should be large enough <b>to enclose one</b> of
    your objects of interest, but small enough <b>not to enclose two</b> objects
    as this can cause the algorithm to 'switch' objects during tracking. Please note
    that you can change the tracking radii at any point; the 'Tracking Radii' are read again any time you
    click the 'Track selected object' button. This means that you can subsequently track objects of
    different sizes.

<h3>Tracking: Track length</h3>
<p width=400>
    Here, you can specify the number of frames that you would like to track the object.
    Please note that you do <b>not</b> need to start tracking at the first frame.
    Simply move the time slider on the image forward and then select an object and click
    'Track selected object'. Also note that you can track different objects for different
    lengths.

<h3>Cropping radii</h3>
<p width=400>
    Once you have tracked some objects you can use the 'Crop along tracks' button to
    get a cropped view on your tracked objects in a coordinate system where the
    respective object stands still. Here you can adjust the size of these cropped view.
<h4>Additional comments</h4>
<p width=400>
    Currently, it only is possible to have the same cropped view on all objects
    that you have track. If you feel you need more flexibility please raise an
    issue on github.

<h3>Track selected object</h3>
<p width=400>
    Use ImageJ's Point Selection tool to select an object in the image and then
hit this button to start its tracking.
The tracking is based on computing the center of mass of the gray-scale values
within above chosen radii.
You do not have to wait for the tracking of one object
to be finished; you can immediately track another object.

<h3>Crop along tracks</h3>
<p width=400>
Opens as many new image windows as there are completed tracks.
Each image window shows the data locally surrounding the respective track.
The size of the shown region can be adjusted by the changing the values in 'Cropping radii'.

<h4>Main ideas behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
One often wants to observe morphological changes of moving objects.
It is however very challenging for the human brain
to focus on the morphological changes as it is distracted by the object's motion.
Thus, having a 'stabilized view' on the object, where its translocation is eliminated is
very helpful.
In addition, the 'stabilized view' also reduces the amount of data needed to further study the object.

<h3>Show track table</h3>
<p width=400>
    Shows a table with the current tracks.<br>
    Newly computed track positions will be added on the fly.<br>
    All columns can be <b>sorted</b> by clicking on the column names.<br>
    The currently selected object will be highlighted in the image.
