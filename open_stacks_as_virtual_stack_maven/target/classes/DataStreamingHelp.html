<h3>Stream from folder</h3>
<p width=400>
Streams data from a folder containing multiple image stacks, each image stack
containing the XYZ data for one channel and one time-point.
</p>
<h4>Supported image stack formats</h4>
<p width=400>
- Multipage Tiff (LZW compression is supported) <br>
- Hdf5 (please write the name of the data set into below text field) <br>

<h3>Stream from info file</h3>
<p width=400>
Loads an info file that you saved before using
'Save as info file'.
</p>
<h4>Idea behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
Especially if your data format is compressed Tiff stacks
it can take quite some time to parse all the files in a folder.
Once all files are parsed you can save all the extracted information
into one single Info file, which is much faster to load
and thus gives you much faster full access to your data.

<h3>Save as info file</h3>
<p width=400>
Saves the currently active virtual stack as an info file.
The info file contains all the information needed to re-open
the current virtual stack without duplicating any pixel data.
If you open a virtual stack (data stream) from a saved info file the plugin
will stream the data from the original image files.
This makes sense in two cases:<br>
1) You just selected a folder using 'Stream from folder' and want to
stream the same files faster the next time you start ImageJ.<br>
2) You cropped your data stream, either using the 'Crop as new stream' function in this
plugin or using the 'Crop along tracks' function in the 'Big data tracker' plugin,
and want to save the cropped view without duplicating the data.<br>

<h3>Save as Tiff stacks</h3>
<p width=400>
    Saves the current stream as a sequence of multi-page Tiff files; one
    file per channel and time-point.
</p>
<h4>Idea behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
    A sequence of Tiff stacks is a convenient and readily compatible format for storage and further processing.
    For instance you might want to deconvolve each stack or register stacks against each other
    using other software such as Huygens for deconvolution or Elastix for registration.

<h3>Crop as new stream</h3>
<p width=400>
    Crops the current stream based on a rectangular selection tool and shows it
    in a new image window.
</p>
<h4>Idea behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
    First of all the browsing of cropped data will be even faster, because
    the software needs to load less data per z-slice.
    More importantly however, the cropped data might be small enough to fit into RAM
    (using: 'Duplicate to RAM') and thereby enable fast processing
    in ImageJ; or, you may want to save the cropped data to disk (using 'Save as Tiff stacks') for
    further processing with other softwares.

<h3>Duplicate to RAM</h3>
<p width=400>
Loads all images and copies them into the RAM.
Make sure that you have enough RAM before doing this.
Also be prepared that this might take quite some time!
</p>
<h4>Idea behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
Some operations in ImageJ using virtual stacks are very slow or not even
possible at all. Thus it might be necessary to copy the whole data
into RAM.
