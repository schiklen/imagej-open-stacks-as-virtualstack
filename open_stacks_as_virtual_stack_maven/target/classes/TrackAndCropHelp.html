<h3>Track selected object</h3>
<p width=400>
Use ImageJ's Point Selection tool to select an object in the image and then
hit this button to start its tracking.
The tracking is based on computing the center of mass of the gray-scale values
within above chosen radii.
You do not have to wait for the tracking of one object
to be finished; you can immediately track another object.

<h3>Crop along tracks</h3>
<p width=400>
Opens as many new image windows as there are completed tracks.
Each image window shows the data locally surrounding the respective track.
The size of the shown region can be adjusted by the changing the values in 'Cropping radii'.

<h4>Main ideas behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
One often wants to observe morphological changes of moving objects.
It is however very challenging for the human brain
to focus on the morphological changes as it is distracted by the object's motion.
Thus, having a 'stabilized view' on the object, where its translocation is eliminated is
very helpful.
In addition, the 'stabilized view' also reduces the amount of data needed to further study the object.

<h3>Show track table</h3>
<p width=400>
    Shows a table with the current tracks.<br>
    Newly computed track positions will be added on the fly.<br>
    All columns can be <b>sorted</b> by clicking on the column names.<br>
    The currently selected object will be highlighted in the image.
